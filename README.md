# Prematurity Classification

This project aims to predict whether a baby is preterm or full-term based on brain connectivity matrices. The project uses machine learning models to analyze these matrices and classify the prematurity status of a baby. The model is trained on a dataset of brain connectivity matrices and their corresponding prematurity status labels.

## Project Overview

- **[Streamlit App](https://martinijfb-prematurityclassification-streamlitapp-lnvapl.streamlit.app/)**: The main interface for interacting with the model is through a Streamlit app. This app is hosted on the Community Cloud, providing an easy way to visualize and interact with the model's predictions. 
- **Experiment Notebook**: The `experiment_1.ipynb` notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the process used to train the model. This includes data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation. This notebook is intended to give insight into the methodology and thought process behind the model development.

## How to Use

1. **[Streamlit App](https://martinijfb-prematurityclassification-streamlitapp-lnvapl.streamlit.app/)**: Access the Streamlit app on the Community Cloud to interact with the model and see its predictions.
2. **Experiment Notebook**: Open the `experiment_1.ipynb` notebook to understand the steps taken to train and evaluate the model.

This project showcases the application of machine learning in healthcare and serves as a demonstration of skills in data science and model deployment.
